# M245_POC

Uber but with airplanes

This is a small project made in the context of a class. In this class we learned a lot essentially about how to start a startup, and pitch the idea to investors, and as part of it we learned about proofs of concepts (POCs). Therefore, we had to make one. This is said POC.

This is essentially Uber + Swiss Public Transports + Airplanes. Basically, on top of this could be built a framework to allow users to go from point A to point B in an airplane with a lot less fuss than with a commercial airliner.

The idea is to have a lot of 'nodes' throughout Switzerland (by default, could be added to lots of other countries later as necessary) all connected to each other by:

- trains
- public transports
- airplanes

The idea for this app is to get you an Uber from where you're currently at, to one of these nodes, and from there to get you to the closest node to where you need to be using public transports and airplanes, and then get you an Uber from there to where you need to be.

Obviously, as this is a POC, what's implemented here is the node system, and the finding the shortest path between them. The idea would be to later put these calculations on a server that would serve as back end. The other thing would be to make the entire interface for the airplane piolts, and lastly update the UI to make it look better, as currently it's more functional than anything.
